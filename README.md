# aesd-assignments
This repo contains public starter source code, scripts, and documentation for AESD assignments

## Setting Up Git

Use the instructions at [Setup Git](https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git) to perform initial git setup steps. For AESD you will want to perform these steps inside your Linux virtual machine, since this is where you will be doing your development work.

## Setting up SSH keys

This step is optional but will save you from needing to enter your password every time you interact with the git server.  See instructions in [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://help.github.com/en/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

## Specific Assignment Instructions

Some assignments require further setup to pull in example code or make other changes to your repository before starting.  In this case, see the github classroom assignment start instructions linked from the assignment document for details about how to use this repository.
